# open-face
Your online avatar that can be exported to games


**This is just a proposal**

## Idea

Create webpage where anyone could create his/her face (or whole body) by adjusting various sliders. Just like you can do when creating own player in nba 2k, fifa, ufc and various other games. Whole project could be based on three.js example with [Lee Perry-Smith head](https://threejs.org/examples/#webgl_materials_normalmap). There only needs to be added sliders to change nose size, ears size, ... and map those on vertexes and their positions.

Settings of sliders could be then "exported" or better converted to various games sliders. Let's say if I create my face through open-face, and want to use it in nba 2k, open-face would recommend what settings I should use in game to get as similar result as possible.  Next I could "convert" same open face to other games. Benefit of this is getting rid of having to adjust all the sliders in each game individually, but do it only once and then easily get values of sliders for each game.

Final open-face could be also exported to .json, which's format would be open. Games could use this format and import open-face right away.
